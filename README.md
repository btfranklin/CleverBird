`CleverBird` is a Swift Package that provides a convenient way to interact with OpenAI's chat APIs and perform various tasks, including token counting and encoding. The package is designed to deliver a superior Developer Experience (DX) by making the chat thread the center of the interactions.

`CleverBird` includes support for document embeddings and similarity queries. This makes it a versatile tool for a broad range of applications, especially cases where chat prompts need enhanced contextual memory.

`CleverBird` is focused narrowly on chat-based interactions, and making them awesome.

Please note that `CleverBird` is an *unofficial* package, not provided by OpenAI itself.

## Features

### Core Features
- Asynchronous API calls with Swift's async/await syntax
- Streamed responses for real-time generated content
- Built-in token counting for usage limit calculations

### Specialized Features
- Token Encoding: Facilitates token counting and encoding through the `TokenEncoder` class.
- Document Embedding and Similarity Queries: Utilize the `EmbeddedDocumentStore` class for managing and querying document similarities.

## Usage Instructions

Import the `CleverBird` package:

```swift
import CleverBird
```

Initialize an `OpenAIAPIConnection` with your API key. Please note that API keys should always be loaded from environment variables, and not hard-coded into your source. After you have loaded your API key, pass it to the initializer of the connection:

```swift
let openAIAPIConnection = OpenAIAPIConnection(apiKey: <OPENAI_API_KEY>)
```

Create a `ChatThread` instance and add system, user, or assistant messages to the chat thread:

```swift
let chatThread = ChatThread()
    .addSystemMessage(content: "You are a helpful assistant.")
    .addUserMessage(content: "Who won the world series in 2020?")
```

Generate a completion using the chat thread and passing the API connection:

```swift
let completion = try await chatThread.complete(using: openAIAPIConnection)
```

The `complete(using:)` method also includes various optional parameters:

```swift
let completion = chatThread.complete(
    using: openAIAPIConnection, 
    model: .gpt4, 
    temperature: 0.7, 
    maxTokens: 500
)
```

In the example above, we created a completion using a specific model, temperature, and maximum number of tokens. All parameters except `connection` are optional. The full list of parameters is as follows:

- `connection`: The API connection object (required).
- `model`: The model to use for the completion.
- `temperature`: Controls randomness. Higher values (up to 1) generate more random outputs, while lower values generate more deterministic outputs.
- `topP`: The nucleus sampling parameter. It specifies the probability mass to cover with the prediction.
- `stop`: An array of strings. The model will stop generating when it encounters any of these strings.
- `maxTokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate.
- `presencePenalty`: A penalty for using tokens that have already been used.
- `frequencyPenalty`: A penalty for using frequent tokens.
- `functions`: The tool functions (aka "actions") to make available to the model.
- `functionCallMode`: The function calling mode: `.auto`, `.none`, or `.specific`.

The response messages are automatically appended onto the thread, so
you can continue interacting with it by just adding new user messages
and requesting additional completions.

You can customize each call to `complete(using:)` with different values for the same parameters on subsequent calls in the same thread, if you want:

```swift
let completion = try await chatThread.complete(
    using: openAIAPIConnection,
    model: .gpt35Turbo, 
    temperature: 0.5, 
    maxTokens: 300
)
```

Generate a completion with streaming using the streaming version of a chat thread:

```swift
let chatThread = ChatThread().withStreaming()
let completionStream = try await chatThread.complete(using: openAIAPIConnection)
for try await messageChunk in completionStream {
    print("Received message chunk: \(messageChunk)")
}
```

Just like with the non-streamed completion, the message will be automatically
appended onto the thread after it has finished streaming, but the stream
allows you to see it as it's coming through.

Calculate the token count for messages in the chat thread:

```swift
let tokenCount = try chatThread.tokenCount()
```

If you need to count tokens or encode/decode text outside of a chat thread,
use the `TokenEncoder` class:

```swift
let tokenEncoder = try TokenEncoder(model: .gpt3)
let encodedTokens = try tokenEncoder.encode(text: "Hello, world!")
let decodedText = try tokenEncoder.decode(tokens: encodedTokens)
```

## Using Functions

`CleverBird` supports Function Calls. This powerful feature allows developers to define their own custom commands, making it easier to control the behavior of the AI. Function Calls can be included in the `ChatThread` and used in the `complete()` method.

First, define your function parameters and the function itself. The `Function.Parameters` class is used to set the properties and required parameters of your function.

```swift
let getCurrentWeatherParameters = Function.Parameters(
    properties: [
        "location": Function.Parameters.Property(type: .string,
                                                 description: "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"),
        "format": Function.Parameters.Property(type: .string,
                                               description: "The temperature unit to use. Infer this from the user's location.",
                                               enumCases: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"])
    ],
    required: ["location", "format"])

let getCurrentWeather = Function(name: "get_current_weather",
                                 description: "Get the current weather",
                                 parameters: getCurrentWeatherParameters)
```

Then, initialize your `ChatThread` with your API connection and an array of functions:

```swift
let chatThread = ChatThread(functions: [getCurrentWeather])
    .addSystemMessage(content: "You are a helpful assistant.")
```

Finally, call the `complete(using:)` function to generate a response. If the assistant needs to perform a function during the conversation, it will use the function definitions you provided.

Please note that functions are only supported in non-streaming completions at this time.

## Using Embeddings

The `EmbeddedDocumentStore` class provides a convenient way to manage and query a collection of documents based on their similarity. This class allows you to:

- Add documents to an internal store.
- Generate embeddings for those documents using a specified model.
- Query the store for similar documents to a given input document.

First, add an instance of the `EmbeddedDocumentStore` to your code:

```swift
let openAIAPIConnection = OpenAIAPIConnection(apiKey: "your_api_key_here")
let embeddedDocumentStore = EmbeddedDocumentStore(connection: connection)
```

You can add a single document or a batch of documents to the store.

```swift
let singleDocument = "My single document"
try await embeddedDocumentStore.embedAndStore(singleDocument)

let documentCollection = ["First document", "Second document", "Third document"]
try await embeddedDocumentStore.embedAndStore(documentCollection)

```

You can query the store for documents that are similar to an input document.

```swift
let similarityResults = try await embeddedDocumentStore.queryDocumentSimilarity("Query text here")
let mostSimilarResult = similarityResults.first?.document ?? "No result returned"
```

The store can be saved to and loaded from a file (represented in JSON format) for persistent storage.

```swift
embeddedDocumentStore.save(to: fileURL)
embeddedDocumentStore.load(from: fileURL)
```
